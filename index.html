								<h3>ASME at UCLA Flagship Combat Robotics (15lb) </h3>
								<p>I worked as a lead on the chassis and drivetrain subteams of Dorime Ameno, the combat robot shown above. <br /><br />
									What I learned: How to work with strict weight and size limitations and use finite element analysis to improve structural weaknesses.<br /><br />
									What I would improve on: Making the chassis easier to manufacture and assemble. There are too many parts that require tight tolerances to fit together and areas that may be hard to reach with hand tools. There is also an unessassary amount of screw holes around the chassis. Although the perforation of the steel plate armor may help with weight issues down the line.  </p>

									<h3>Rani Therapeutics Manufacturing Fixture</h3>
									<p> When I was an R&D Mechanical Engineering Intern at Rani Therapeutics, I designed and built a fixture that was a part of the assembly process for their flagship medical device. The fixture is actively used on the production line. Due to a NDA, I can't show the fixture :( <br /><br />
										What I learned: How to design for manufacturing and work with pneumatics, heat cylinders and thermocouplers. How to characterize and validate fixtures through experiments and tests.<br /><br />
										What I would improve on: The fixture required the alignment of two parts to be perfectly aligned to create a consistent and standardized heatseal. Due to wear and tear and everday use, parts become loose every so often, which requires tightening and realignment. If I were to redesign the fixture, I would make this process more streamline by creating a calibrating block that will position the two sealing sides in the correct alignment before they are tightened.  </p></p>

								<h3>3 DOF Positioning Mechanism for MRI Robot</h3>
								<p>I took an engineering sketch for the positioning mechanism of an MRI probing robot arm and made it manufacturable by researching off the shelf parts and redesigning how the mechanism is put together. Due to the nature of operating within an MRI machine, I was limited to nonferous metals and parts of a small form factor. This required me to do research on medically safe metals such as brass and titatium and how to design around space limitations. This involved working with very small bearing and designing a linear slide because off-the-sheft parts were too large.
									<br /><br />
									What I learned: How to design small form factor mechanisms. How to avoid singularities within certain positions of the mechanism.  <br /><br />
									What I would improve on: I believe that I can make the mechanism even smaller by using machined brass rather than 3D printed PLA. However, this method may bring up weight concerns as the weight of the brass bearings at the joints may cause the joint to sag and have a lot of friction. </p>

								<h3>6 DOF Robotic Arm</h3>
								<p>After taking robot kinematics and dynamics classes, I wanted to build my own robotic arm. This is my attempt at a PRRRRR 6 DOF robotic arm with one prismatic joint and 5 revolute joints. I am currently in the process of 3D printing, assembling and coding the arm.<br /><br />
									What I learned: I ran into friction problems with the prismatic joint and the carriage system. This process taught to slow down and think about all the extra forces that I did not consider when I first designed the robotic arm. <br /><br />
									What I would improve on: I would revise the carriage system to use adjustable slides, so that they can made parallel manually rather than relying on the tolerances of the 3D printer.  </p>

								<h3>6 DOF Robotic Arm Trajectory Planning</h3>
								<p> For my robot dynamics class final, I coded a trajectory planning script for a 6 DOF robotic arm that goes through a path to machine a small part at its end effector. 
									
									What I learned: How to use the robotics toolbox in MATLAB. How to implement robot kinematic and dynamic equations to find the posititon and required velocities and torques of all joints and motors <br /><br />

									<h3>ASME at UCLA Combat Robotics (3lb) </h3>
									<p>I designed and built the 3lb combat robot shown above. This was my first project at UCLA where I was able to apply the SolidWorks that I learned from class.
									 <br /><br />
						
									What I would improve on: This design had many flaws. The hole for the weapon shaft was not toleranced correctly, nor designed appropriately to allow for easy assembly. The bottom screw holes of the motor mount were too low, making them very hard to use with an allen key. Considering how thin the floor of the robot was, more support was needed for the motor mounts. The weapon is not appropriately sized for a 3lb bot, so its effective range is too small. The bulky design of the chassis was not very space efficient and could have been a lot smaller. </p>

							<h3>Introfuction to Manufactoring Machining </h3>
							<p>I machined this chair using a mill, lathe and CNC mill.   <br /><br />
							 What I learned: SolidCAM </p>
